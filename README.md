# Reference Cat

Reference Cat is a magical tool written in Python
(would have been html, but you can't write to a `<input type='file'/>`)
designed to do referencing quickly

I made it because at Uni etc you need to reference things properly, and
it's stupidly difficult and nothing really clicked fuffiling my criteria:

* Runs on Linux
* Doesn't look crap
* Â£0

It uses GTK right now, but it can be easily expanded.

It looks like this:

![Edit Reference](screenshots/edit.png)

## State of things

### Things that don't work

* Export :(
* Delete individual references (although the button appears correctly)

### Things I should change

* Move generic code out of the GTK module
* Split the GTK module into parts (main, edit, export)
* Make the generated reference a bit more human

### Things to do

* HTML5 backend as a server (then, I get my own way. Just fire up localhost!)
* Other backends if I can be bothered (but I use Linux, so meh HTML5 will do for everything else)
